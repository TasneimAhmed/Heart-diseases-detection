Description: This dataset contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer-valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.

Objective: Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required). Build classification models to predict whether or not the patients have Heart Disease. Also fine-tune the hyperparameters & compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms
